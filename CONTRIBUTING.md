# Contributing to meteor-upgrade-to-3

üéâ **Thank you for your interest in contributing to meteor-upgrade-to-3!** üéâ

We warmly welcome contributions from the community! This project helps developers migrate from Meteor 2.x to 3.x by automating the transition from Fibers to async/await, and we'd love your help making it even better.

Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new migration features, improving documentation, or suggesting enhancements, every contribution makes a difference. We believe that collaborative development makes for better tools, and we're excited to work with you!

## üöÄ How You Can Help

We're actively looking for contributors to help with:

- **Building new migration features and improvements** - Add support for new Meteor 3.x APIs or patterns
- **Enhancing existing codemods** - Improve the accuracy and coverage of current transformations
- **Bug fixes** - Help identify and resolve issues in the migration process
- **Documentation** - Improve guides, examples, and API documentation
- **Testing** - Add test cases, improve test coverage, or help with manual testing
- **Performance optimizations** - Make the migration process faster and more efficient

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 14+** (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git** for version control
- Basic understanding of **TypeScript** and **AST transformations** (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meteor-upgrade-to-3.git
   cd meteor-upgrade-to-3
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Test the CLI**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/meteor-upgrade-to-3.js --help
   ```

6. **Start development mode** (watches for changes and rebuilds):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Understanding the Project Structure

- **`src/`** - TypeScript source code
  - **`cli.ts`** - Command-line interface and argument parsing
  - **`upgrader.ts`** - Main migration engine and orchestration
  - **`plugins/`** - Individual transformation plugins
  - **`config.ts`** - Configuration and default settings
- **`bin/`** - Executable CLI entry point
- **`__tests__/`** - Test files (to be added)

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Test the CLI manually** on sample Meteor projects

5. **Commit your changes** with descriptive commit messages

6. **Push to your fork** and **create a pull request**

## üìù Contributing Guidelines

### For Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the bug
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Sample code** that demonstrates the problem
- **Environment details** (Node.js version, OS, Meteor version)
- **CLI command** you ran and any relevant options

**Use our bug report template:**
```markdown
## Bug Description

2. Step two
3. Step three

## Expected Behavior
What should happen

## Actual Behavior
What actually happened

## Environment
- Node.js version:
- OS:
- Meteor version:
- CLI command used:

## Sample Code
```js
// Paste relevant code here
```

### For Feature Requests

We love new ideas! When suggesting features:

- **Explain the use case** - why would this be helpful?
- **Describe the proposed solution** - what should it do?
- **Consider alternatives** - are there other ways to solve this?
- **Provide examples** - show what the transformation should look like

### For Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

- **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on it
- **Open an issue first** for significant changes to discuss the approach
- **Keep changes focused** - one feature/fix per PR

#### Code Standards

- **Follow TypeScript best practices**
- **Use ESLint configuration** - run `npm run lint:fix` before committing
- **Format code with Prettier** - run `npm run format` before committing
- **Write descriptive commit messages** following [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you're changing behavior
2. **Add tests** for new functionality (when test infrastructure exists)
3. **Ensure all checks pass**:
   ```bash
   npm run check-all  # Runs lint, format check, and build
   ```
4. **Write a clear PR description** explaining:
   - What changes you made
   - Why you made them
   - How to test the changes
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes

5. **Be responsive** to code review feedback

## üîß Building New Migration Features

### Plugin Architecture

The tool uses a plugin-based architecture. Each transformation is implemented as a separate plugin:

```typescript
import { BasePlugin } from './types';
import { Transform } from 'jscodeshift';

export class MyCustomPlugin extends BasePlugin {
  name = 'my-custom-transform';
  description = 'Transform X to Y';
  
  transform: Transform = (fileInfo, api, options) => {
    const j = api.jscodeshift;
    const root = j(fileInfo.source);
    
    // Your transformation logic here
    
    return root.toSource();
  };
}
```

### Current Transform Plugins

- **async-api**: Collection methods (`findOne` ‚Üí `findOneAsync`, etc.)
- **cursor-async**: Cursor methods (`count` ‚Üí `countAsync`, etc.)  
- **meteor-call-async**: `Meteor.call` ‚Üí `Meteor.callAsync`
- **meteor-user-async**: `Meteor.user` ‚Üí `Meteor.userAsync`
- **callback-to-await**: Callback patterns ‚Üí `async/await` (planned)

### Adding New Transformations

1. **Identify the pattern** you want to transform
2. **Create a new plugin** in the appropriate directory
3. **Write transformation logic** using jscodeshift or ts-morph
4. **Add configuration options** if needed
5. **Register the plugin** in the main upgrader
6. **Test thoroughly** with various code patterns
7. **Document the transformation** in README and comments

### Testing Your Plugin

- **Create test cases** with before/after code examples
- **Test edge cases** - nested functions, different syntaxes, etc.
- **Verify the plugin doesn't break** existing functionality
- **Test on real Meteor projects** to ensure practical utility
